I’m on to the next adventure / Thank you

Dear all,

I hope you’re doing well!

I wanted to let you know that I’ll be leaving my position as Software Engineer here at HCL Technologies and my last day is May 25th (this Friday). 

While I’m excited for the new opportunity ahead of me, leaving HCL and great working relationships like this one is definitely bittersweet. 
I’m wishing you all the best moving forward, And, thanks again for being a part of making my time here at HCL such a great one!

Please keep in touch. I can be reached at my personal email address olegario.castellanos@gmail.com or via my cell phone +521 55 27 11 93 09.

Thanks for your friendship and support.
