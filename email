Hey [Name],

As you already know, I’ll be leaving my position as [job title] here at [Company], and my last day is [date].

While I’m excited about the new opportunity, there’s also a big part of me that’s sad to be saying goodbye to amazing co-workers just like you. I can’t tell you how much I’ve enjoyed our time working together, and how much I value the friendship you’ve shown me over the past [how long you’ve worked together].

You made me look forward to coming into the office, and I’ll always remember [funny moment or inside joke].

This might be the end of my time with [Company]. But, it’s definitely not the end of our friendship. You have my number—so don’t hesitate to reach out when you want to grab [coffee/drinks/lunch], and I’ll be sure to do the same!

It’s been great working together, [Name], and I’ll definitely keep in touch!

All the best,
